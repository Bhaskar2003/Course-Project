CODEBOOK FOR THE COURSE PROJECT.
COURSE- GETTING AND CLEANING DATA

ALL THE DATA WAS READ USING read.table FUNCTION. 

VARIABLES (as per their assignment in the programme)

1) xtrain                   table   base table from file train/x_train.txt
2) ytrain                   table   base table from file train/y_train.txt
3) subjecttrain             table   base table from file train/subject_train.txt
4) train                    table   created using cbind function. THE MAIN TRAINING SET.

5) xtest                    table   base table from file test/x_test.txt
6) xtest                    table   base table from file test/y_test.txt
7) subjecttest              table   base table from file test/subject_test.txt
8) test                     table   created using cbind function. THE MAIN TEST SET.

9) mainset                  table   created using rbind fuction. THE TRAIN+TEST SETS MERGED TO FORM mainset.
10)variablenamestable       table   read from features.txt file. Contains all the variable names.
11)variablenames            vector  character vector. It is the second column of the variablenamestable which actually contains all the variablenames.

VARIABLENAMES CHANGED AND MADE DESCRIPTIVE USING SUB FUNCTION.

12)indicescolumnsrequired   vector  integer vector. Contains indices of the variablenames which contain mean or standard deviation measures. (names having the string mean or std in them)
13)datasetrequired          table   dataset with ONLY the names of required variables. Extracted from the mainset but only columns whose indices are in the indicescolumnsrequired
                                    This ensures that the datasetrequired contains only the mean measures and the standard deviation measures.
                                    
14)activitylabelstable      table   base table from activity_labels.txt file. Contains the activity names such as STANDING, WALKING, LAYING etc.
15)activitylabes            vector  character vector. The second column of the activitylabelstable. It actually contains all the acctivity names such as STANDING, WALKING, LAYING etc.

DATASET GROUPED USING Student and Activity columns.

16)solutiontable            table   the final dataset grouped by Student ---- Activity ------ Average/Mean data.
17)solutionfile.txt         file    a text file (.txt) which contains all the data from solutiontable in raw text. (Just like the one which was provided to us in the beginning of this assignment (but a lot less messy and lot more informative :p))
